i go by she/her all the way, please do not call me a they or a he it makes me feel uncomfortable.

c+h is okay unless i have dni in my name or i am with friends! ^_^
i love making new friends so do not be afraid to say hello, usually whispering me first while im usually afk is best because it takes me a moment to reply due to me being a little shy or blunt near new people unless they like what i like!

main interests currently are epic the musical, phighting, and coroika! feel free to ask about my other interests.
